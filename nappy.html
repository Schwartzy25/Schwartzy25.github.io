  <h2>The Client </h2>
  <p>My partner - Sophie</p>
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>Sophie was running out of time in her day to get everything she neeeded to done. As a new mother who had just started a course at General Assembly (GA) there just weren't enough hours in the day as she wanted to spend as much time as possible with her family.</p>
  <h2>The Goal</h2>
  <p>To create a way for Sophie to streamline the rest of her daily tasks so that she could focus on spending time with her family and the work that came with starting a new course at GA.</p>

  <h2>My Role</h2>
  <p>As the sole UX designer on this project my role was to find the problem, create a solution and then a low-fidelity clickable prototype</p>
  <h2>Skills Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>User Interviews</li>
    <li>Sketching</li>
    <li>Wireframing</li>
    <li>Prototyping</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>My Process</h2>
  <h3>Discovery</h3>
  <p>Through mulitple user interviews, with my partner Sophie, I discovered that she was struggling with time. After sketching multiple concept maps I realised there were some ways that collecting, and passing on, information to the nanny could be streamlined. So I began sketching...

  <h3>User Journeys and Flows</h3>
  <p>Here are the iterations of my user journeys and flows. I tested and had to redo it as I had created a monster app. This was pointed out during a critique session</p>

  <h3>Prototype</h3>
  <p>Here will be all the information about the prototype. Should I embed Marvel?</p>
